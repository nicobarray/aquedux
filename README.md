> Redux over the wire

Aquedux is a Redux enhancer that enables seamless real-time synchronization across many JavaScript clients.

With Aquedux, you can write your server code with the same logic than your web/native app. There is no need to
use another library that forces you to add GraphQL or RESTfull endpoints. Everything is a Redux app.

Aquedux shares your App state across every connected instance. It can be a Node.js microservice, a React app, or anything you would imagine.

It makes the writing of client and server app easy. There is no need to add another technical layer. If you know how to use Redux, you know how to use Aquedux.
